# Hello there

This repo is here to allow you to see React code samples without getting lost in the resources that I share with friends and co-workers

I consider myself framework-agnostic - choosing Vue or React depending on whatever is the best tool for the job

# Branch: Trello

This was a simple clone of Trello I was asked to create in an hour during a mock Triplebyte interview

_What made it interesting:_

- While it's a simple application, it's meant to show my focus on [Atomic Design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/)
- I believe every component should be as small and reusable as possible in order to scale React projects
- This means components are created intentionally, with all their tests, styling, and documentation in a folder for easy consumption

_In a production environment:_

- Would add docs to each component folder
- Would utilize Storybook to develop components in an isolated environment
